AI-Powered War Game Video Production Design
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the design for an automated video production system to generate dynamic, 60-second video clips for a turn-based war game. The system is designed to produce cinematic-quality videos illustrating the aftermath of each turn, based on a human adjudicator's written report.
The core of the system is an AI agentic orchestrator built with LangGraph, which will automate the end-to-end video production process. It will coordinate between AI models for image and video generation (Midjourney/Stable Diffusion, Runway Gen-3 Alpha), video enhancement (Topaz Video AI), and professional editing software (DaVinci Resolve). The design incorporates a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step to ensure quality control and final narrative polish.
2. High-Level Workflow
The production process is divided into three distinct phases.
Phase 1: Pre-Game Setup and Asset Creation
This phase is conducted once before the game begins to establish a consistent visual identity.
Style and Asset Generation (Midjourney/Stable Diffusion):
Action: Define a consistent aesthetic (e.g., "gritty documentary," "stylized game footage").
Tool: Use an image-to-image AI model to create consistent, high-quality reference images of vehicles, environments, and special effects.
Output: A library of visual assets and a style guide.
Game Database Definition:
Action: Establish a database to track game state, unit locations, and turn-by-turn outcomes.
Output: A structured game database.
Phase 2: End-of-Turn Automation
This phase is repeated at the end of each game turn to produce the video clips.
AI Orchestrator Trigger:
Input: The adjudicator's written report describing the turn's aftermath.
Action: The LangGraph orchestrator is triggered to start the automated workflow.
AI Orchestration (LangGraph):
Function: The orchestrator manages the state and flow of the video generation.
Action: Uses Claude as its "brain" to generate and refine prompts, calls external APIs, and manages the process from start to finish.
Video Generation, Enhancement, and Pre-Assembly:
Action: The orchestrator automatically calls various AI tools via API to generate clips based on the adjudicator's report and pre-defined assets.
Output: Raw video clips (Runway Gen-3), enhanced video clips (Topaz Video AI), and a rough-cut edit decision list (EDL).
Phase 3: Post-Production and Delivery
This phase involves human review and final assembly to create the polished 60-second video.
Professional Video Editing (DaVinci Resolve):
Input: Enhanced video clips and the rough-cut EDL from the orchestrator.
Action: A human editor uses Resolve for color grading, audio post-production, adding music and effects, and fine-tuning the narrative flow.
Quality Control and Approval:
Action: The editor reviews the final 60-second clip.
Loop: If the editor rejects the clip, the process loops back to the orchestrator with feedback for regeneration. If approved, the video is rendered.
Final Delivery:
Output: The final 60-second video is rendered and distributed to the war game players.
3. System Architecture: LangGraph Agentic Orchestrator
The system's intelligence and automation are powered by a LangGraph orchestrator, which is fundamentally an agentic AI application.

Component Details
Component	Technology	Function
Orchestrator	LangGraph	Manages the entire workflow as a stateful, directional graph. It enables robust execution, conditional routing, and human oversight.
LLM "Brain"	Anthropic Claude API	The Large Language Model used to interpret the adjudicator's report and generate detailed, multi-shot prompts for the video AI.
Image Generation	Midjourney/Stable Diffusion	Used in Phase 1 to create the visual style and library of consistent assets.
Video Generation	Runway Gen-3 Alpha API	Used in Phase 2 to generate individual, high-quality video clips from text prompts and reference images.
Video Enhancement	Topaz Video AI API	Used in Phase 2 to upscale resolution, denoise footage, and improve motion stability of AI-generated clips.
Game Database	(Custom)	A custom database that stores factual game data to provide context for the orchestrator.
Video Editor	DaVinci Resolve	The professional post-production tool used for fine-tuning the video, including color grading, audio, and final assembly.
LangGraph Nodes and Functionality
Node: Event Trigger: Initiates the process upon receiving the adjudicator's report.
Node: Data Retrieval: Queries the game database to fetch relevant facts and statistics that add context to the narrative.
Node: Prompt Scripting: Uses Claude to synthesize the adjudicator's narrative, game data, and style assets into a sequence of detailed, cinematic video prompts for Runway.
Node: Video Generation: Calls the Runway Gen-3 API to create raw video clips for each prompt.
Node: Video Enhancement: Passes the raw clips to the Topaz Video AI API for quality improvement.
Node: Video Assembly: Organizes the enhanced clips and generates a rough-cut EDL to prep for professional editing.
Node: DaVinci Editor Prep: A transitional node that packages the video assets and rough-cut data for the human editor in DaVinci Resolve.
Conditional Routing
The graph includes a critical conditional edge after the human review in DaVinci Resolve.
If the editor approves the video, the graph moves forward to the final rendering step.
If the editor requests a regeneration, the graph loops back to the Prompt Scripting node with feedback, allowing the AI to generate a new set of clips based on human input.
4. Key Takeaways
Reliable and Scalable: LangGraph provides the stability and control needed for this multi-step, stateful process.
Hybrid AI/Human Workflow: The design intelligently automates the repetitive and time-consuming tasks (generation, enhancement) while leveraging human expertise for creative oversight and final polish.
Modular and Adaptable: The node-based architecture allows for easy swapping of AI models or tools as technology evolves.
Consistency is Key: The Phase 1 asset creation is crucial for maintaining a cohesive visual style across all generated clips throughout the game.
